<h1> AirBnB Project </h1>
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.
Each task is linked and will help you to:

<h2>STEPS</h2>
--> <h3> The console </h3>:
<p> The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.
This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.
The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine. </p>

--> <h3>Web static</h3>:
<p> <ul>
<li>learn HTML/CSS</li>
<li>create the HTML of your application</li>
<li>craete template of each project</li></ul>

--> <h3>MySQL storage</h3>:
<p> <ul>
<li>replace the file storage by a Database storage</li>
<li>map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.</li></ul>

--> <h3>Web framework - template</h3>
<p> <ul>
<li> create your first web server in Python </li>
<li> make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database </li></ul>

--> <h3>RESTful API</h3>
<p> <ul>
<li> expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface </li>
<li> manipulate your objects via a RESTful API </li></ul>

--> <h3>Web dynamic</h3>
<p> <ul>
<li> learn JQuery </li>
<li> load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API </li></ul>
